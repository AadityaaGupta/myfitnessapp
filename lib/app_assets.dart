🟢 Muscle-Gaining Tips:

• Protein: Ensure at least 1.2–1.6g of protein per kg of body weight daily. Include plant proteins like tofu, tempeh, lentils, chickpeas, quinoa, and plant-based protein powders.

• Healthy fats: Incorporate avocados, coconut oil, olive oil, peanut butter, and seeds for extra calories.

• Carbs: Choose complex carbs such as quinoa, sweet potatoes, and brown rice to fuel workouts and recovery.

• Frequent meals: Eat 4–6 smaller meals/snacks a day to ensure a consistent calorie intake.

• Strength training: Focus on compound exercises (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench press) and aim to lift heavier with progressive overload.
